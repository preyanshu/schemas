### **Schema Proposal: Carbon Footprint Validation for Digital Products (Using Ecochain API)**

#### **Data Source Name**

Ecochain provides a platform to track the carbon footprint of digital products, such as software, websites, and digital goods. By using Ecochain's API, users can validate the environmental impact of a product, from its development to its consumption, ensuring that the digital product adheres to sustainability practices and provides transparent carbon footprint data.

#### **API Endpoint URL**

`GET https://api.ecochain.com/v1/products/{product_id}/carbon-footprint`

#### **Purpose**

This schema allows the validation of the carbon footprint of digital products, ensuring that developers, businesses, and consumers can track the environmental impact of digital goods. This can be used for certifications, environmental reporting, or to help consumers make environmentally-conscious decisions when choosing digital products.

#### **Sample JSON Response**

    }
  ],
  "reporting_date": "2024-02-12"
}` 
```
#### **Technical Breakdown**

This schema validates the carbon footprint of a digital product using Ecochain's API. The key validation conditions include:

-   **Total Carbon Emissions**: The `total_emissions` field must contain a valid number representing the carbon impact of the product, measured in kilograms of CO2 equivalent (kgCO2e).
-   **Lifecycle Phases**: The emissions associated with each phase (development, hosting, and end-of-life) are calculated and validated.
-   **Certification**: The product must have an associated green certification, verified by a third-party authority, proving that it meets specific environmental standards.

#### **Key Use Cases**

-   **Environmental Reporting**: Organizations can validate the carbon footprint of their digital products for internal sustainability reports.
-   **Green Certifications**: Products that meet sustainability standards can be certified and displayed as eco-friendly, increasing consumer trust.
-   **Consumer Decision Making**: Consumers can verify the environmental impact of digital products before making purchases, contributing to sustainable choices.

#### **Demo/Test Case**

-   **Scenario**: A company wants to validate the carbon footprint of their mobile application "EcoApp" to apply for a green certification.
    -   The company uses Ecochain's API to retrieve the carbon footprint data for "EcoApp."
    -   The API returns the total emissions for the product, broken down by development, hosting, and end-of-life phases.
    -   The product also has a valid certification from a third-party authority confirming its green status.
    -   The schema validator ensures the emissions are above zero and matches the required criteria for certification.
    -   Once validated, the company can display the "Green Product Certification" and use the data in their sustainability report.

#### **Real-World Use Case**

This schema can be integrated into sustainability-focused platforms or marketplaces that list digital products. Businesses can display eco-friendly certifications for their products, and consumers can verify and make informed choices based on the environmental impact of the products they choose to use.
