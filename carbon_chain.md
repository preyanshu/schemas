### **Schema Proposal: Carbon Footprint Tracking for Supply Chain (Using CarbonChain API)**

#### **Data Source Name**

CarbonChain provides a real-time carbon emissions tracking system for businesses, helping them measure the environmental impact of their operations. The CarbonChain API helps organizations track the carbon footprint of their supply chains, from raw material production to end-user consumption.

#### **API Endpoint URL**

`GET https://api.carbonchain.com/v1/supply_chain/{supply_chain_id}/carbon_footprint`

#### **Purpose**

This schema validates and tracks the carbon footprint across various stages of a supply chain. By integrating with CarbonChain’s API, businesses can ensure their products are sustainably sourced, monitor their environmental impact, and make improvements to reduce carbon emissions at each supply chain stage.

#### **Technical Breakdown**

This schema helps businesses monitor, validate, and reduce the carbon footprint associated with their supply chain operations. Carbon emissions data is collected at various stages of the supply chain and tracked over time. The API also helps validate the environmental impact of the product throughout its lifecycle, ensuring that the company's sustainability efforts are being accurately measured.

**Key Validation Conditions:**

-   **Total Carbon Footprint**: The `total_carbon_footprint` is calculated by summing the emissions from all stages of the supply chain. It should match the sum of emissions from all individual stages (`carbon_emission`).
-   **Carbon Sources**: Each stage in the supply chain should have an associated `carbon_emission` value, and the emission sources must be valid (e.g., "Mining of Natural Rubber", "Factory production").
-   **Carbon Reduction Efforts**: There should be a list of implemented efforts to reduce emissions, along with the associated carbon reduction values.
-   **Carbon Footprint Trends**: The trend should reflect the change in carbon emissions over time, with past values for the previous year(s) and a forecast for the upcoming year(s).
-   **Certifications**: The response should contain any relevant certifications that validate the sustainability and carbon reduction efforts of the organization.
-   **Next Report Due**: A future date when the next carbon footprint report is expected.

**Key Use Cases:**

-   **Supply Chain Transparency**: Businesses can use this API to gain a detailed view of the carbon footprint associated with each part of their supply chain, from raw material extraction to final product transportation.
-   **Sustainability Reporting**: Organizations can leverage this schema to track their progress toward sustainability goals and present verifiable reports to stakeholders, investors, and regulatory bodies.
-   **Carbon Footprint Forecasting**: Companies can forecast their future emissions based on past trends, helping them set carbon reduction goals and assess the impact of their sustainability initiatives.
-   **Sustainability Certifications**: The API helps track certifications like ISO 14001 or the Carbon Trust Standard, which validate the company’s commitment to sustainability and carbon footprint reduction.

### **Demo/Test Case**

#### **Scenario**: A company is working on reducing the carbon footprint of their sneaker production and wants to track their progress using the CarbonChain API.

-   **Step 1**: The company queries the CarbonChain API using the `GET /v1/supply_chain/{supply_chain_id}/carbon_footprint` endpoint, providing the `supply_chain_id` for their sneaker production supply chain.
-   **Step 2**: The API returns data on the carbon footprint at each stage (raw material extraction, manufacturing, packaging, and transportation).
-   **Step 3**: The company verifies the total carbon footprint and checks if the reduction efforts are documented, such as sourcing sustainable materials or switching to electric manufacturing processes.
-   **Step 4**: The company checks the carbon footprint trends over the last year and forecasts for the upcoming year to measure the impact of their sustainability initiatives.
-   **Step 5**: If the company has met its sustainability goals, it can issue reports to investors or regulatory bodies, including certifications like ISO 14001 and the Carbon Trust Standard.
-   **Step 6**: If there are areas for improvement, the company can adjust its supply chain practices and set new carbon reduction goals for the following year.

### **Real-world Use Case**

This schema can be integrated into a variety of industries, including manufacturing, retail, and logistics, where businesses are working to minimize their environmental impact. For example, a fashion brand could integrate this schema into their operations to ensure that their clothing line is produced sustainably and their carbon emissions are reduced at each stage of production.

A company in the logistics industry can use this to track the carbon footprint of their transportation methods, comparing different routes or shipping methods to find the most sustainable options. The data from this schema can also be used in annual sustainability reports, helping companies demonstrate their commitment to reducing their environmental impact.

By integrating CarbonChain's API into business operations, organizations can track their supply chain's carbon emissions, reduce their environmental footprint, and gain certifications that prove their commitment to sustainability.
